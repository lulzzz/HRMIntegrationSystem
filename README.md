# There are two projects in this repo.

## 1. A set of .NET Core Microservices located in Sticos.Backend
Open the Sticos.Backend.sln file and build it. 
Each microservice needs to be started individually (use multiple startup projects).
Navigate to the localhost:port/swagger/index.html. (`http://localhost:5000/swagger/index.html` for common API)

## 2. An angular application located in Sticos.UI
Navigate to the Sticos.UI folder and run `npm install` to install dependencies. Then run `npm start` to run the application locally.
See the README.md file in Sticos.UI for more details.
